# Time_Serie_Analysis

## Introduction and Data Set
The data set which has used comes from DBLP and its name is “dblp-2020-04-01.xml.gz”. DBLP (https://dblp.uni-trier.de/) is a site that maintains bibliographic data publications, mainly in the field of computer science. In addition to the possibility to navigate and see the data of published works through the website, this data is available as an XML (Extensible) compressed file
Markup Language). As part of this work initially, we have extracted the data we had been interested in,  from the above data set. Then, we presented the data in a time serie form and then proceeded to analyze it with the ultimate goal of predicting future prices. Our data concerns the number of publications per year. So we built a prediction model that could
be used to predict the total number of publication in the future.

## Requirements
We used the Python programming language to extract the data from the XML file. And for the time serie analysis the Gnuplot open-source software tool.

## ok
Publications per year with Gnuplot (Bar Chart).
